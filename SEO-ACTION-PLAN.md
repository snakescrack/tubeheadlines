## 🚨 CRITICAL - DO THESE FIRST

### 1. Google Search Console Verification (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Status:** ❌ Not verified (empty verification code)

**Action Steps:**
1. Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Add property: `tubeheadlines.com`
3. Choose "HTML tag" verification method
4. Copy the verification code (looks like: `content="abc123xyz..."`)
5. Replace `YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE_HERE` in `/index.html` line 17
6. Deploy to live site
7. Click "Verify" in Google Search Console

**Why Critical:** Without this, Google won't index your site properly and you won't see any Google traffic.

### 2. Submit Sitemap to Google Search Console
**Status:** ⏳ Pending (need verification first)

**Action Steps:**
1. After verification, go to "Sitemaps" in left menu
2. Submit: `https://tubeheadlines.com/sitemap.xml`
3. Wait 24-48 hours for Google to crawl

**Expected Result:** Google will discover all 1,241+ video pages

---

### 3. Fix Soft 404 Errors in Google Search Console
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**Action Steps:**
1. After verification, go to "Coverage" or "Pages" report
2. Look for "Soft 404" errors
3. For each affected URL, click "Request Indexing"
4. Google will re-crawl and see the new video embeds + content

**Why This Works:** We already fixed the issue by adding:
- Video embeds (iframe)
- Video stats (views, publish date)
- Video descriptions
- Unique content on each page

## 📊 MONITORING & VALIDATION

### Check These Weekly:
1. **Google Search Console**
   - Coverage report (should show increasing "Valid" pages)
   - Performance report (track impressions and clicks)
   - Video enhancement report (check video indexing)

2. **Bing Webmaster Tools**
   - Already verified ✅
   - Submit sitemap: https://www.bing.com/webmasters
